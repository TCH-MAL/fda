# MATLAB Functional Data Analysis library developed by Jim Ramsay 

This is the original code developed by Jim Ramsay for MATLAB. It is no longer available at http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/.
The FTP site has disappeared. Fortunately, I have been using a copy of this code library for several years, which I am making available here. 
I have updated it with code version dating from 08/08/2017, the last available version I was able to obtain from the Wayback Machine internet archive, 
https://web.archive.org/web/20170713053602/http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/

So far as I can tell, this is only MATLAB library for FDA available. There is a Python library and, I believe, an R package, but nothing for MATLAB.

For convenience, I reproduce Ramsay's front page to his FDA site, which can still be found in the web archive above:

## Ramsay's original welcome:

*Functional data analysis, which lots of us like to call "FDA", is about the analysis of information on curves or functions. For example, these twenty traces of the writing of "fda" are curves in two ways: first, as static traces on the page that you see after the writing is finished, and second, as two sets functions of time, one for the horizontal "X" coordinate, and the other for the vertical "Y" coordinate.*

*FDA is a collection statistical techniques for answering questions like, "What are the main ways in which the curves vary from one writing to another?" In fact, most of the questions and problems associated with the usual multivariate data analyzed by statistical packages like SAS and SPSS have their functional counterparts.*

*But what is unique about functional data is the possibility of also using information on the rates of change or derivatives of the curves. We use slopes, curvatures, and other characteristics made available because these curves are intrinsically smooth, and we can use this information in many useful ways. For example, our high school physics tells us that force = mass times acceleration, and that suggests that we look at the acceleration or second derivative of the pen's position as a function of time. What we see in the plot of the magnitudes of the acceleration vector is that acceleration hits nearly ten meters/second/second. That's a lot of energy! Equally remarkable is the stability of these acceleration records from one trial to the next. Also, note that where the acceleration magnitudes are near zero, both the X and Y accelerations must simultaneously be zero. The brain seems to know what it's doing!*
